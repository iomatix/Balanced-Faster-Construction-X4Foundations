<content id="ws_3431829267" name="Balanced Faster Construction" description="[h1]Balanced Faster Construction - X4Foundations[/h1] This mod rebalances station module construction in X4: Foundations by adjusting build times across all module types. The new timings are carefully tuned based on community feedback, personal experience, and reference data to provide a more streamlined, faster, and balanced station building experience. [h2]What’s Changed?[/h2] [h3]Connections[/h3] [list] [*]All connection modules now complete in [b]3 minutes[/b]. [/list] [h3]Defense[/h3] [list] [*]Claim modules take [b]12 minutes[/b] to build, while all other defense modules complete in [b]7 minutes[/b]. [/list] [h3]Docking Modules[/h3] [list] [*]Build times are set at [b]6, 9, 13, and 15 minutes[/b] (for the respective tiers). [/list] [h3]Piers[/h3] [list] [*]Construction time scales with size: [list] [*][b]4 minutes[/b] for the smallest [*][b]8 minutes[/b] for the next size [*][b]13 minutes[/b] for larger ones [*][b]16 minutes[/b] for the largest [/list] [/list] [h3]Habitat[/h3] [list] [*]Times now vary by module size: [list] [*][b]4 minutes[/b] for small [*][b]8 minutes[/b] for medium [*][b]13 minutes[/b] for large habitat modules [/list] [/list] [h3]Builder[/h3] [list] [*]Builder modules are adjusted by size: [list] [*][b]7 minutes[/b] for medium [*][b]13 minutes[/b] for large [*][b]18 minutes[/b] for extra-large [/list] [/list] [h3]Equipment[/h3] [list] [*]Similar scaling as Builder modules: [list] [*][b]7 minutes[/b] for medium [*][b]13 minutes[/b] for large [*][b]18 minutes[/b] for extra-large equipment modules [/list] [/list] [h3]Production[/h3] [list] [*]Production modules are tiered (per data from [url=https://x4prodchart.com/]x4prodchart.com[/url]): [list] [*][b]3 minutes[/b] for the fastest tier [*][b]8 minutes[/b] for the mid tier [*][b]12 minutes[/b] for the slowest [/list] [/list] [h3]Storage[/h3] [list] [*]Storage module build times depend on size: [list] [*][b]4 minutes[/b] for small [*][b]8 minutes[/b] for medium [*][b]10 minutes[/b] for large [/list] [/list] [h3]Other Modules[/h3] [list] [*]All remaining modules – including venture platforms, welfare gambling halls, casinos, and scrapworks – now consistently build in [b]5 minutes[/b]. [/list] [h2]How It Works[/h2] The mod uses XML `replace` directives to update the build time values in the game’s files. For example, all “Other” category modules have been set to 300 seconds (5 minutes), ensuring a uniform, faster build time across these components. Enjoy a more responsive and balanced station construction experience with these optimized build times! [i]By downloading from Nexus you will support the author[/i] Created by iomatix.
